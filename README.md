```

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: .NET 8.0 WPF
- **Language**: C# 12
- **Database**: SQLite with Dapper
- **AI**: Ollama integration
- **Virtual Environment**: Unreal Engine WebSocket
- **UI Framework**: MaterialDesignInXaml
- **Dependency Injection**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- **Logging**: Serilog

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 (recommended) or VS Code with C# extension
- Ollama (for AI functionality)
- Optional: Unreal Engine (for virtual environment features)

## Building the Project

### Using Visual Studio

1. Open `HouseVictoria.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
2. Restore NuGet packages (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution)
3. Build the solution (Build > Build Solution or Ctrl+Shift+B)
4. Run the application (F5 or Debug > Start Debugging)

### Using Command Line

```bash
# Navigate to solution directory
cd C:\Users\kurtw\Victoria\HouseVictoria

# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run --project HouseVictoria.App\HouseVictoria.App.csproj
```

## Configuration

Edit `HouseVictoria.App\App.config` to configure endpoints and settings. For **Elite Dangerous** users: you can use an AI contact as your ship computer via **COVAS: Next**; see [COVAS_ELITE_DANGEROUS_SETUP.md](Docs/COVAS_ELITE_DANGEROUS_SETUP.md).

```xml
<appSettings>
  <add key="OllamaEndpoint" value="http://localhost:11434"/>
  <add key="MCPServerEndpoint" value="http://localhost:8080"/>
  <add key="UnrealEngineEndpoint" value="ws://localhost:8888"/>
  <add key="TTSEndpoint" value="http://localhost:5000"/>

## Key Design Patterns

- **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModels for all UI components
- **Dependency Injection**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- **Event Aggregator**: Loosely coupled communication between components
- **Repository Pattern**: Database abstraction layer
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time updates for metrics and events

## Contributing

This is a modular project designed for incremental development. Each module should be:
1. Implemented independently
2. Tested thoroughly
3. Integrated with the existing system
4. Documented with inline comments

## MetaTrader 4 Integration

House Victoria includes an optional MetaTrader 4 bridge for AI-assisted trading workflows. To configure and use it:

- Configure `MT4DataPath` in `HouseVictoria.App\App.config` as described in the MT4 integration guide.
- Follow the setup and usage instructions in `MT4Bridge/README.md`.
- Example usage code is provided in `MT4Bridge/UsageExample.cs`, which assumes the main application has been built so that `App.ServiceProvider` and `ITradingService` are available.

## Hardware Monitoring

House Victoria uses **WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)** for hardware monitoring, which:
- ✅ **No kernel drivers required** - Won't trigger Windows Defender
- ✅ **CPU/RAM monitoring** - Full support via Performance Counters
- ⚠️ **Limited temperature/fan support** - WMI has limitations (see documentation)

See [WINDOWS_DEFENDER_WINRING0.md](WINDOWS_DEFENDER_WINRING0.md) for detailed information about hardware monitoring capabilities.

## Support

For issues or questions, please refer to the module-specific documentation within each service and UI component.
